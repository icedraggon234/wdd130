            <p>The great state of Utah has a diverse geography ranging from arid deserts and sand dunes to pine forests and mountain valleys. 
                It is known for having the greatest snow on earth! It is the 13th largest state but is the 11th least densely populated.
                 It has a great economy and standard of living and is known for its five beautiful national parks and multiple state parks. 
                 Utah is a great place to live!</p>
