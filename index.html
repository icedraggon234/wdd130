                <p>My name is Jared Reynolds. I live in Herriman Utah. My dad is American and my mom is Cuban. 
                    I have an older brother and sister, and a younger brother and sister with me in the middle. 
                    We have a pet cat named Mira, and she is a lilac point balinese. 
                    I like playing board games, watching videos on YouTube of all kinds, and computer games. 
                    My major is Applied Technology. I'm currently working at Pizza Hut part-time while I go to school. 
                    If I could go anywhere in the world, it would be to a little island near Japan called Rabbit Island, a place swarming with rabbits and bunnies. 
                    My career goal is to work with computers and technology in Quality Assurance. 
                    I have lived in Gilbert, Arizona and Herriman, Utah. 
                    I've traveled to Miami Florida to visit family and go to the Miami Seaquarium and Anaheim, California on a Disneyland trip.</p>

                <img src="images/utah.jpg" alt="Delicate Arch at the Utah Arches National Park.">
                <p>The great state of Utah has a diverse geography ranging from arid deserts and sand dunes to pine forests and mountain valleys. 
                    It is known for having the greatest snow on earth! It is the 13th largest state but is the 11th least densely populated.
                    It has a great economy and standard of living and is known for its five beautiful national parks and multiple state parks. 
                    Utah is a great place to live!</p>
